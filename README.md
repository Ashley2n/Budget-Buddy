# Budget-Buddy
Build a basic personal budget tracking web application that allows users to input incomes and expenses, view totals, and see whether they are under or over budget. You will implement both front-end templates and back-end logic using Flask. The application must reflect solid Python OOP design and Flask web architecture.
